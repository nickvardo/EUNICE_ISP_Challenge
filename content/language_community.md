# Language & Community

**Fast start**
- “Survival German” phrases for appointments and daily life.
- A2–B1 courses scheduled around shifts (evening/weekend options).

**Find your people**
- Local meetups (tech, sports, families), volunteer groups, and hobby clubs.
- **Buddy network**: get matched with a colleague or resident for practical tips and social support.

**Why it matters**
- Language reduces admin stress; community reduces loneliness and early churn.
- Your 90-day plan includes class options and upcoming events.
