# Family & Childcare

**What to expect**
- Typical placement time: **up to 45 days** after application.
- Short-term care or flexible shifts can bridge the first weeks.

**Steps**
1) Collect documents (IDs, child’s birth certificate, address/registration).  
2) Submit applications to nearby childcare providers (we list contacts).  
3) Confirm hours that match your shift schedule.  
4) Receive placement, sign the agreement, and share start date with your manager.

**Support**
- We can pre-check forms, suggest interim options, and align start dates with your onboarding.
- Ask for language support if needed—providers are used to international families.

**School-age children**
- Bring certificates/transcripts. We’ll connect you with the local school office and translation help.
